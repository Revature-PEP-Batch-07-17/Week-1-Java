## The Big Picture:  

### FullStack
* Refers to the entire technology stack of the application
* These developers work with BOTH FrontEnd and BackEnd

### FrontEnd
* Includes everything that the User/client can view or interact with
* Developers make user friendly UI and should think about things like accessibility, website/application design and mobile/browser friendly views
* Main languages used: JavaScript (functionality) and HTML/CSS (actual design)

### BackEnd
* Includes servers, databases, and other internal architecture that drives the application
* The user/client will normally never interact with this portion of the application
* Developers create code that communicates with servers and databases to manipulate/save information to be given to the FrontEnd
* Main languages used: Java and SQL

## Java as a Language:
* High level language: 
    - we don't need to specify every detail of the code, so it is more user-friendly
* Strongly typed: 
    - data types are enforced
* Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Language: 
    - everything is class based so we work with the class/object and associate methods to them
* Platform Independent: 
    - we can run our program on any computer regardless of setup
* Widely used

## JDK, JRE, JVM Overview:

* JDK (Java Development Kit)
    - contains: compiler and launcher  
  
* JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
    - contains: libraries and dependencies that the program needs to run  
  
* JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
    - converts byte code (.class file) to machine code (what the computer reads)
